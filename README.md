# My React Native App - "Deadlined":

### App Description:

“Deadlined” (icon is a cartoon timebomb) is a scheduler app with a strong emphasis on splitting tasks into 
subtasks, each with a deadline and reward, to encourage better time management. The app is bomb themed 
(cartoon-style) with metaphors of splitting big bombs into little bombs, then diffusing those bombs.

Deadlined solves time management problems regarding tasks with deadlines. Specifically, it helps to prevent 
procrastination, which is known for issues like poor work performance and physical/mental health decline [1]. 
Procrastination is caused by demotivating factors like feeling out of control, and distant, intangible outcomes 
[2]. By splitting tasks into manageable subtasks with deadlines and rewards, the motivational power of shorter 
deadlines is utilized [3], and the demotivating factors can be circumvented.

Main Features:
- Users can add a task, and subtasks within that task. Tasks are given start and end dates, but each 
subtask is given a “weight” value (relative length/difficulty) and the task’s days are allocated 
proportionate to this.
- Users can edit or remove tasks and subtasks.
- Users can “complete” a subtask, which also completes the task if it is the last subtask.
- Users can move between three home screens: “Home” (lists today’s subtasks), “Tasks” (lists all 
tasks/subtasks), and “Calendar” (shows tasks/subtasks on a calendar and updates with any changes).
- Users can search up tasks/subtasks by name, and order tasks by earliest, latest, or alphabetical order. 
- Users can receive a daily notification listing the subtasks for that day.

Target Demographic:
- Anyone regularly juggling big projects (high school/tertiary students, project managers and team members), or 
anyone who struggles with time management or motivation.
